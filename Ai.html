        <h1>Artificial intelligence (AI) </h1> 
        <p id="a1"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSgaFhfTZ9DGQ1tosF9DsBicsR68IeYR6SIrQ&usqp=CAU" width="200" id="a2"><u class="s1"> Artificial intelligence (AI)</u> is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans.<u class="s1">AI</u> research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
        <br> <br> 
            
 The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by major <u class="s1">AI</u> researchers who now describe <u class="s1">AI</u> in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.<br><br>

<u class="s1">AI</u> applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of <u class="s1">AI</u>, a phenomenon known as the <u class="s1">AI</u> effect.[3] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be <u class="s1">AI</u>,having become a routine technology.

Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[16] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.<br><br>

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[18] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[19] The first work that is now generally recognized as <u class="s1">AI</u> was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons"


By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic <u class="s1">AI</u> or <u class="s1">GOFAI</u>, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely associated with this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons. James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic <u class="s1">AI</u>) and the brain (connectionist). Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descarte, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others. Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.</span></p><button onclick="Rayyan()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
